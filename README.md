# ⚡ Predicting Electric Vehicle (EV) Range using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Project Overview
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are the future of sustainable transportation — but one major challenge remains: **range anxiety**, the fear that the vehicle may run out of charge before reaching its destination.

This project uses **Machine Learning (ML)** to accurately **predict the driving range of an EV** based on its specifications and real-world conditions.  
It also demonstrates how AI-based prediction systems can improve driver confidence, route planning, and energy efficiency.

## ❓ Problem Statement
The driving range of an electric vehicle depends on many changing factors such as speed, terrain, temperature, and battery health.  
Drivers often struggle to estimate how far they can travel before the next charge, which causes uncertainty and inefficient trip planning.

**This project aims to:**
- Develop an ML model that predicts EV range (in kilometers).
- Identify key parameters that affect range.
- Provide a simple, interactive system to display predictions and insights.

## 🚗 Introduction

### 1️⃣ Why EV Range Prediction?
Traditional range estimation (shown by car dashboards) often uses static formulas and fails to adapt to real-world factors.  
Machine Learning offers a better approach by **learning from actual vehicle and trip data** to predict more accurately.

**Key factors affecting EV range:**
- Battery capacity (kWh)
- Vehicle weight (kg)
- Motor power / efficiency
- Average driving speed
- Route type (city/highway)
- Temperature and terrain
- Use of AC, heater, or other power-consuming features

### 2️⃣ Applications
- Helps drivers plan charging stops and optimize routes.
- Assists EV manufacturers in improving design efficiency.
- Enables smart mobility systems to manage fleets effectively.
